This is a sample implementation of an audio player using straight up
HTML and JavaScript. It depends on modern audio capabilities of 
browsers (all major browsers should support it) and uses the buzz.js
library for all audio interaction, including detection for MP3
and OGG format support.

Knockout.js is used for user interface data binding and interactions.

A lightweight audio player JavaScript object was developed (contained
in js/player.js) to wrap buzz.js and handle play/pause logic, among
other things.
